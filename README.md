# Intro-to-deep-learning
Homework of the introductory course of Deep Learning at TUM

In this course, we learned several deep learning architectures to tackle several problem. In this repository one can find projects on facial keypoint detection, semantic segmnentation, autoencoders on MNISt and CIFAR10 classification.

Concerning the facial keypoint detection, we considered a dataset consisting of face images and facial keypoints. We used a convolution neural network in order to predict the coordinates of these points. 

One can obtain the following results even after a short training time. The purple points is the ground truth and the red ones are predicted by the model.
