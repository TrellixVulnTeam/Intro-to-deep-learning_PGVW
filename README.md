# Intro-to-deep-learning
Homework of the introductory course of Deep Learning at TUM


In this course, we learned several deep learning architectures to tackle several problem.

For example, we considered facial keypoint detection. Given a dataset consisting of face images and facial keypoints, we use a convolution neural network in order to predict the coordinates of these points. 

One can obtain the following results even after a short training time. The purple points is the ground truth and the red ones are predicted by the model.

Furthermore, one can find projects on semantic segmnentation, autoencoders on MNISt and CIFAR10 classification in this repository.
